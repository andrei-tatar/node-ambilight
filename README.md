# node-ambilight

## Hardware
RPi 3 + RPi camera + ESP8266 + ws2812 

## Software
node.js + opencv + angular client


## Flow 
camera -> opencv -> sampling and adjustments (node.js) -> web socket -> ESP8266 -> ws2812 leds.

### Project is still a work in progress. Mostly a weekend hack. Needs a bit of refactoring and publishing to an npm package to make it easier to run.
