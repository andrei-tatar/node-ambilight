# node-ambilight

RPi 3 + RPi camera + ESP8266 + ws2812 
node.js + opencv + angular client

flow is: 
camera -> opencv -> sampling and adjustments (node.js) -> web socket -> ESP8266 -> ws2812 leds.

Project is still a work in progress. Mostly a weekend hack. Needs a bit of refactoring and publishing to an npm package to make it easier to run.
